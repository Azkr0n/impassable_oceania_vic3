README - Pacific Islands Passable States Mod
===========================================

üìÅ Installation Instructions:

This mod allows various Pacific island regions (such as Kanak, Micronesia, Solomon Islands, etc.) to be passable by removing the "impassable" flags from their provinces.

To install it properly, follow these steps:

1. Locate your Victoria 3 installation directory.
   Default path is:
   C:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Victoria 3\

2. Inside that folder, go to:
   game\map_data\state_regions

   Full path:
   C:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Victoria 3\game\map_data\state_regions

3. Replace the existing state region files with the modified versions provided in this mod.
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure to backup the original files before replacing them!

4. Launch the game with your mod enabled.

‚úÖ The previously impassable Pacific islands should now be traversable, and ports can be built or used on them as intended.

Note:
If you are using other mods that alter state regions, make sure there are no conflicts.

Enjoy your more accessible Pacific!
